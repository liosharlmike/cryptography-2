# File Encryption and Decryption Using Advanced Algorithms

## Overview
This project implements a Flask-based web application for encrypting and decrypting files using the **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** algorithm. It provides a user-friendly interface for encrypting files and decrypting them using a secret key.

## Features
- **File Encryption**: Encrypt files using AES-128.
- **File Decryption**: Decrypt files using a secret key.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple web interface for uploading and downloading files.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/file-encryption-project.git
   cd file-encryption-project
